# JUST-IN-BOX-OFFICE

A simple application that tries to replicate movie themed applications at a primary level.

This Android application here is the progress of my development in android applications . I have explored various platforms features and conecting them to android studio also I have gained much exposure in Android Studio IDE.
In this project I have learned and applied the realtime database Firebase and its perfect working syncrhronization with Android Studio also this application features News API call from the Entertainment Weekly magazine.
